<p>When you are ready to record your chosen parts of the score, please follow the directions below:</p>
 <ol>
    <li><p>Find a quiet time and place.</p></li>
    
    <li><p>Use your best microphone option (iPhone, computer, or professional quality).</p>
    <p>Tips: Make sure you point the sensitive end at your mouth. Put it close enough that you get a lot of your voice, but not so close that you peak - that is, don't let your levels get into the red or your sound distorts. If you are getting a lot of sounds of breathing or wind noise from making 'p' or 'b' sounds, try holding the mic up a bit higher â€“ in line with your nose -- but still pointing at your mouth. You want your recording to be loud enough that the levels get near the red, but never get into it. If you're going to do a quiet sound followed by a loud sound, you can move the microphone a little bit away as you get louder.</p></li>
    
    <li><p>Record your sound in an uncompressed format (wav, aif, aiff, or au). Please avoid recording as an mp3 or ogg. Select 16 bit, 44.1kHz or higher, if your recorder lets you set bits or sample rate. Do not convert your files before uploading them.</p></li>
    
    <li><p>Record each section separately. The maximum duration for each recording is 90 seconds. Write down what file goes with what part of the selected panel.</p></li>
    
    <li><p>Listen to your recordings and re-record any that have background noise. Select your best version.</p></li>
    
    <li><p>Upload your selections. Keep a record of which panel and subsection you are uploading.</p>
        <p>Note: Your sounds should be made by just you (your voice and body, no other instruments). Please do not upload sounds for other people. If they want to submit their sounds, they need to sign up so we have a record of all participants.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
