<p>Pick some parts of the score or symbols you want to create sound for.</p>
<p>Practice your sounds.</p>
<p>To record your sounds, you will need to find a quiet place.  You may need to
    close doors, shut windows and turn things off, such as fans or wait for 
    things like clotheswashers to finish. Some places are quietest late at 
    night or early in the morning.</p>

<p>You will also need a microphone. If you own a professional microphone, you
    should use it.  Some phones, especially iPhones, have good microphones and
    you could also use them. Some computers may have good internal microphones,
    but most do not.  Some headset mics may be good - or not. If you have more 
    than one microphone option, you may need to experiment to see which sounds 
    best. </p>

    <p>Practice using your mic.  Make sure you point the sensitive end at your 
    mouth. Put it close enough that you get a lot of your voice, but not so 
    close that you peak - that is, don't let your levels get into the red or 
    let your sound distort.  If you are getting a lot of sounds of breathing 
    or wind noise from making 'p' or 'b' sounds, try holding the mic up a bit 
    higher - even with your nose, but still pointing at your mouth.</p>

    <p>You want your recoring to be loud enough that the levels get 
    <em>near</em> the red, but never get into it.  You want to be loud enough 
    to be heard, but not so you you distort. If you're going to do a quiet 
    sound followed by a loud sound, you can move the microphone a little bit
    away as you get louder.</p>

    <p>You should record your sound in an <em>uncompressed</em> format. This means
you could record as a wav, aif, aiff, or au. You should avoid recording as an
mp3 or ogg, if you can. If your recorder lets you set bits or sample rate,
16 bit, 44.1kHz are ok or higher is also acceptable. Do not convert your files
before uploading them.</p>

<p>When you're ready, make a recording. You should record each symbol or 
    gesture seperately (or, if you know how, you can edit the file into small 
    pieces later). You may end up with a lot of short recordings. To keep track
    of them, you may need to write down what file goes with what symbol on the 
    page. You may want to record the same symbol a few times and pick the 
    version you like best.</p>

    <p>Listen to your recordings. If you hear background noise like a train passing
    or hear distortion, you'll want to try again. Make sure to listen to every
    file before you upload it. If you find a recording has a problem, drag it
    to a different folder or the rubbish bin so that you don't upload it by
    accident.
    </p>

    <p>Now that you have an audio file that sounds good, you can upload it!
    Make sure you know which score page it goes with and where it goes on the 
    page.</p>

    <p>Your sounds should be made by just you. Don't upload sounds for other people.
    If you have a friend who wants to make sounds also, have them sign up.
