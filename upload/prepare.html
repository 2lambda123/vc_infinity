    <p>When you are ready to record your chosen parts of the score, please follow the directions below:</p>
 <ol>
    <li><p>Find a quiet time and place.</p></li>
    <li><p>Use your best microphone option (iPhone, computer, or professional quality). If you can record in an <i>uncompressed</i> format (wav, aif, aiff, or au) that is preferable to compressed (mp3 or ogg).</p></li>
 <li><p>Click on the appropriate active panel. Record each section, making a note of your location on that panel. The maximum duration for each recording is <b>90 seconds</b>.</p></li>   
<li><p>Listen to your recordings and re-record as needed (avoiding any background noises). Label each recording with the panel and number (e.g., panel5sound1) and save to a folder on your computer, easily accessible for you to use during the upload process.</p></li>     
<li><p>To upload each of your files, go to ‘<a href="submit.php">Submit audio</a>’. Click at the appropriate location on the score. You may need to scroll sideways to locate the whole panel.</p></li>
<li><p>Note: Your sounds should be made by just you (your voice and body, no other instruments). Please do not upload sounds for other people. If they want to submit their sounds, they need to sign up so we have a record of all participants.</p></li>
